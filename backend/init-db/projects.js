      "Telling Stories is how we communicate. Throughout history, we have used a ‘language’ to develop our culture, explain our social needs and identify who we are. ‘Languages’ have been many and varied. Sometimes they are words and letters; sometimes they are pictures; sometimes they are based on the technology we use. We use computers for all the things above. They are run using program’s. The language of programming is very different from words and pictures, but the goal is the same; to ‘communicate meaning’.",

      "Travel is something humans do to get from one place to another. Sometimes we have to travel over places we cannot do without help from a machine.  Travelling through the air, for instance. Over 70% of the earth is covered by water.To travel significant distances, humans have invented waterproof shells that take many forms; powerboats, ships, yachts, canoes. They all rely on some source of power to make them move; humans row and paddle, wind, engines of different sorts. The fact is it is our understanding of how to make these ‘power sources’ work for us that makes travel over water possible.",

It could be a petrol motor, or a battery; all sorts of things can propel the car forward. Where this power comes from is very important for all sorts of reasons. Some motors make gases that make our world not such a good place to live. We need to think about what sorts of power is ‘safe’ and doesn’t change things in our world, but still can get us from one place to another.",
